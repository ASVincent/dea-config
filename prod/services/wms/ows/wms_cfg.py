Mangrove canopy cover version 1, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.

The mangrove canopy cover product provides valuable information about the extent and canopy density of mangroves for each year between 1987 and 2016 for the entire Australian coastline.
The canopy cover classes are:
20-50% (pale green), 50-80% (mid green), 80-100% (dark green).

The product consists of  a sequence (one per year) of 25 meter resolution maps that are generated by analysing the Landsat fractional cover (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.94250.v1) developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and the Global Mangrove Watch layers (https://doi.org/10.1071/MF13177) developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.

The mangrove canopy cover version 1 product has the following caveats:
it underestimates the overall extent of mangroves.
it doesnât detect small mangrove communities i.e. smaller estuaries in NSW and Victoria
that there is localised confusion between mangroves and wooded freshwater wetlands i.e. Melaleuca swamps, and
in some locations dense dwarf/shrub mangroves that are less than 2 metres tall may be mis-labelled as woodland/open forest/closed forest.""",
