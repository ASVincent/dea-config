WOfS aims is to allow better understanding of where water is usually present; where it is\n    seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been occasionally observed by satellite. WOfS displays the\n    detected surface water from the Australia-wide satellite imagery archive of Landsat 5, 7 and 8.</p>\n\n\n<p>The layers available for <strong>Full Summaries</strong> (1986 to present) are:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Filtered Summary: </strong>A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water\n        observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level</li>\n    <li><strong>Confidence: </strong>the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national\n        datasets</li>\n    <li><strong>Summary: </strong>the percentage of clear observations in which water was detected</li>\n    <li><strong>Wet Count: </strong>the number of clear satellite observations in which water was detected</li>\n    <li><strong>Clear Count: </strong> the number of clear satellite observations for the period</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>What is confidence?</h4>\nThe confidence probability is a measure of how confident we are that a location flagged as water is truly water. The\nconfidence information was created by comparing the WOfS with other data, to see how well it matched known water areas\nfrom other sources. These sources are:\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Multi-resolution Valley-Bottom-Flatness (MrVBF)</strong>\n        This uses the terrain across Australia to work out whether an area is likely to be on or near a valley bottom or\n        flat area where water could accumulate.\n    </li><li><strong>MODIS Open Water Likelihood (MODIS OWL)</strong>\n        This is a product similar to WOfS, derived from the low resolution MODIS satellites, showing the likelihood that\n        an area has contained water between 2000 and 2012.\n    </li><li><strong>Terrain slope</strong>\n        This is a second factor created from the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the less likely that water will\n        accumulate in the location.\n    </li><li><strong>Built-up urban areas</strong>\n        The way light is reflected from large buildings and their shadows causes considerable water detection errors in\n        cities. The more built-up an area, the less likely that water will be correctly detected there.\n    </li><li><strong>Observation frequency</strong>\n        Areas where the observation frequency is low typically have poor conditions for water detection. The higher the\n        observation frequency, the more likely that a good water/non-water classification can occur.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The higher the confidence at a location, the more the water result correlates with the confidence factors. However\n    the confidence factors also contain errors, and hence can produce an overstated confidence in some areas such as\n    cities, where the confidence factors are not as useful.</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: lightgrey 0.5px solid\"/>\n\n<p>This product is part of <a href='http://www.ga.gov.au/'>Geoscience Australia</a>'s program to make better use of\n    satellite data, <a href='http://www.ga.gov.au/dea'>Digital Earth Australia</a> (DEA).</p>\n<p>DEA is a platform that uses spatial data and images recorded by satellites orbiting our planet to detect physical\n    changes across Australia in unprecedented detail.

These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively (Sagar et al. 2018). <p/> The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al (2017) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The concepts of the Observed Tidal Range (OTR), and Highest and Lowest Observed Tide (HOT, LOT) are discussed and described fully in Sagar et al. (2017) and the product description for the ITEM v 1.0 product (Geoscience Australia, 2016)."

                      "content": "Inter-tidal zones are difficult regions to characterise due to the dynamic nature of the tide. They are highly changeable environments, subject to forcings from the land, sea and atmosphere and yet they form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms from birds to fish and sea grass. By harnessing the long archive of satellite imagery over Australia's coastal zones in the DEA and pairing the images with regional tidal modelling, the archive can be sorted by tide height rather than date, enabling the inter-tidal zone to be viewed at any stage of the tide regime. <p/> The High Low Tide Composites (HLTC_25) product is composed of two mosaics, distinguished by tide height, representing a composite image of the synthetic geomedian surface reflectance from Landsats 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI NBAR data (Li et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2017). Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010) was used to generate tide heights, relative to mean sea level, for the Australian continental coastline, split into 306 distinct tidal regions. These time and date stamped tidal values were then attributed to all coastal tile observations for their time of acquisition, creating a range of observed tide heights for the Australian coastline. The two mosaics in HLTC_25 are composited from the highest and lowest 20 % of observed tide in the ensemble and are termed HOT and LOT respectively. A geomedian composite for each Landsat band is calculated from the tiles in each ensemble subset to produce the respective HOT and LOT composites. Note that Landsat 7 ETM+ observations are excluded after May 2003 due to a large number of data artefacts. <p/> The time range used for composite generation in each of the 306 polygons of the mosaics are tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The maximum epoch for which the products are calculated is between 1995-2017, although this varies due to data resolution and observation quality. The product also includes a count of clear observations per pixel for both mosaics and attribute summaries per polygon that include the date range, the highest and lowest modeled astronomical tide as well as the highest and lowest observed tide for that time range, the total observation count and the maximum count of observations for any one pixel in the polygon, the polygon ID number (from 1 to 306), the polygon centroid in longitude and latitude and the count of tide stages attributed to every observation used in that polygon of the mosaic. For the count of tidal stage observations, e = ebbing tide, f = flowing tide, ph = peak high tide and pl = peak low tide. The tide stages were calculated by comparison to the modeled tide data for 15 minutes either side of the observation to determine the ebb, flow or peak movement of the tide. <p/> Observations are filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow and band saturation (of any band)."

Tidal modelling on self-similar coastal polygons was performed to minimise regional uncertainty. <p/> Accuracies and limitations related to geomedian compositing of observations are discussed in Roberts et al (2017). <p/> Users should beware of seasonal and diurnal effects in the imagery, especially in the north east of Australia where the footprint of the highest and lowest astronomical tides are large. Consequently, where image acquisition misses the highest astronomical tide, for example, pooling effects of water are still visible in the landscape in lowest observed tidal composite imagery. <p/> This product has been rendered in both true colour and false colour. Validation and interpretation of surface features has not been attempted here. Interpretation of surface features is at the users own discretion."

These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively (Sagar et al. 2018). <p/> The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al (2017) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The concepts of the Observed Tidal Range (OTR), and Highest and Lowest Observed Tide (HOT, LOT) are discussed and described fully in Sagar et al.

They are highly changeable environments, subject to forcings from the land, sea and atmosphere and yet they form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms from birds to fish and sea grass. By harnessing the long archive of satellite imagery over Australia's coastal zones in the DEA and pairing the images with regional tidal modelling, the archive can be sorted by tide height rather than date, enabling the inter-tidal zone to be viewed at any stage of the tide regime. <p/> The High Low Tide Composites (HLTC_25) product is composed of two mosaics, distinguished by tide height, representing a composite image of the synthetic geomedian surface reflectance from Landsats 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI NBAR data (Li et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2017). Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010) was used to generate tide heights, relative to mean sea level, for the Australian continental coastline, split into 306 distinct tidal regions. These time and date stamped tidal values were then attributed to all coastal tile observations for their time of acquisition, creating a range of observed tide heights for the Australian coastline. The two mosaics in HLTC_25 are composited from the highest and lowest 20 % of observed tide in the ensemble and are termed HOT and LOT respectively. A geomedian composite for each Landsat band is calculated from the tiles in each ensemble subset to produce the respective HOT and LOT composites. Note that Landsat 7 ETM+ observations are excluded after May 2003 due to a large number of data artefacts. <p/> The time range used for composite generation in each of the 306 polygons of the mosaics are tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The maximum epoch for which the products are calculated is between 1995-2017, although this varies due to data resolution and observation quality. The product also includes a count of clear observations per pixel for both mosaics and attribute summaries per polygon that include the date range, the highest and lowest modeled astronomical tide as well as the highest and lowest observed tide for that time range, the total observation count and the maximum count of observations for any one pixel in the polygon, the polygon ID number (from 1 to 306), the polygon centroid in longitude and latitude and the count of tide stages attributed to every observation used in that polygon of the mosaic. For the count of tidal stage observations, e = ebbing tide, f = flowing tide, ph = peak high tide and pl = peak low tide. The tide stages were calculated by comparison to the modeled tide data for 15 minutes either side of the observation to determine the ebb, flow or peak movement of the tide. <p/> Observations are filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow and band saturation (of any band)."

The current version (2.0) utilises all Landsat observations (5, 7, and 8) for Australian coastal regions (excluding off-shore Territories) between 1986 and 2016 (inclusive). <p/> ITEM v2.0 has implemented an improved tidal modelling framework (see Sagar et al. 2018) over that utilised in ITEM v1.0. The expanded Landsat archive within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) has also enabled the model extent to be increased to cover a number of offshore reefs, including the full Great Barrier Reef and southern sections of the Torres Strait Islands. The DEA archive and new tidal modelling framework has improved the coverage and quality of the ITEM v2.0 relative extents model, particularly in regions where AGDC cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0 produced discontinuities or the imposed v1.0 cell structure resulted in poor quality tidal modelling (see Sagar et al. 2017). <p/> Examples of regions in ITEM v2.0 where these significant improvements have been noted include: <ul> <li>Dampier Peninsula and King Sound, WA. Improved modelling within King Sound has removed the discontinuities seen at cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0, and expanded the extent of intertidal region being mapped. </li> <li>Tiwi Islands, Coburg Peninsula and Croker Island, NT. Poor spatial representation of the regions tidal regimes in ITEM v1.0 has been improved in v2.0 resulting in extensive onshore reefs and mudflats now being mapped. </li> <li>The full Great Barrier Reef has been mapped, detailing reef structures which expose at low tide. Algorithm amendments have reduced the false positive exposed surface detections resulting from glint and sun glitter. </li> <li>Broad Sound, QLD. Improved tidal modelling has resulted in a smoother intertidal extent map, and a greatly improved confidence layer value for the region. </li> <li>Improvements in the coverage of the DEA archive has allowed many regions unresolved in ITEM v1.0 and showing as 'no data' to be modelled successfully in ITEM 2.0.

Hence, terminology has been adopted for the product to reflect the highest modelled tide observed in a given cell (HOT) and the lowest modelled tide observed (LOT) (see Sagar et al. 2017). These measures are relative to Mean Sea Level, and have no consistent relationship to Lowest (LAT) and Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT). <p/> The inclusion of the lowest (LMT) and highest (HMT) modelled tide values for each tidal polygon indicates the highest and lowest tides modelled for that location across the full time series by the OTPS model. The relative difference between the LOT and LMT (and HOT and HMT) heights gives an indication of the extent of the tidal range represented in the Relative Extents Model. <p/> As in ITEM v1.0, v2.0 contains some false positive land detection in open ocean regions. These are a function of the lack of data at the extremes of the observed tidal range, and features like glint and undetected cloud in these data poor regions/intervals. <p/> Methods to isolate and remove these features are in development for future versions. Issues in the DEA archive and data noise in the Esperance, WA region off Cape Le Grande and Cape Arid (Polygons 236,201,301) has resulted in significant artefacts in the model, and use of the model in this area is not recommended. <p/> The Confidence layer is designed to assess the reliability of the Relative Extent Model. Within each tidal range percentile interval, the pixel-based standard deviation of the NDWI values for all observations in the interval subset is calculated. The average standard deviation across all tidal range intervals is then calculated and retained as a quality indicator in this product layer. <p/> The Confidence Layer reflects the pixel based consistency of the NDWI values within each subset of observations, based on the tidal range. Higher standard deviation values indicate water classification changes not based on the tidal cycle, and hence lower confidence in the extent model. <p/> Possible drivers of these changes include: <ol> <li>Inadequacies of the tidal model, due perhaps to complex coastal bathymetry or estuarine structures not captured in the model. These effects have been reduced in ITEM v2.0 compared to previous versions, through the use of an improved tidal modelling framework </li> <li>Change in the structure and exposure of water/non-water features NOT driven by tidal variation.
