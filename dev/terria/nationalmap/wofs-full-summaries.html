<p><a href='http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/flood/wofs'>Water Observations from Space (WOfS)</a> is a
    web service displaying historical surface water observations derived from satellite imagery for all of Australia
    from 1987 to present day. WOfS aims is to allow better understanding of where water is usually present; where it is
    seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been occasionally observed by satellite. WOfS displays the
    detected surface water from the Australia-wide satellite imagery archive of Landsat 5, 7 and 8.</p>


<p>The layers available for <strong>Full Summaries</strong> (1986 to present) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Filtered Summary: </strong>A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water
        observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence: </strong>the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national
        datasets</li>
    <li><strong>Summary: </strong>the percentage of clear observations in which water was detected</li>
    <li><strong>Wet Count: </strong>the number of clear satellite observations in which water was detected</li>
    <li><strong>Clear Count: </strong> the number of clear satellite observations for the period</li>
</ul>

<h4>What is confidence?</h4>
The confidence probability is a measure of how confident we are that a location flagged as water is truly water. The
confidence information was created by comparing the WOfS with other data, to see how well it matched known water areas
from other sources. These sources are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-resolution Valley-Bottom-Flatness (MrVBF)</strong>
        This uses the terrain across Australia to work out whether an area is likely to be on or near a valley bottom or
        flat area where water could accumulate.
    </li><li><strong>MODIS Open Water Likelihood (MODIS OWL)</strong>
        This is a product similar to WOfS, derived from the low resolution MODIS satellites, showing the likelihood that
        an area has contained water between 2000 and 2012.
    </li><li><strong>Terrain slope</strong>
        This is a second factor created from the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the less likely that water will
        accumulate in the location.
    </li><li><strong>Built-up urban areas</strong>
        The way light is reflected from large buildings and their shadows causes considerable water detection errors in
        cities. The more built-up an area, the less likely that water will be correctly detected there.
    </li><li><strong>Observation frequency</strong>
        Areas where the observation frequency is low typically have poor conditions for water detection. The higher the
        observation frequency, the more likely that a good water/non-water classification can occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>The higher the confidence at a location, the more the water result correlates with the confidence factors. However
    the confidence factors also contain errors, and hence can produce an overstated confidence in some areas such as
    cities, where the confidence factors are not as useful.</p>
