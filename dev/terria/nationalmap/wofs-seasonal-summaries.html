<p><a href='http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/flood/wofs'>Water Observations from Space (WOfS)</a> is a
    web service displaying historical surface water observations derived from satellite imagery for all of Australia
    from 1987 to present day. WOfS aims is to allow better understanding of where water is usually present; where it is
    seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been occasionally observed by satellite. WOfS displays the
    detected surface water from the Australia-wide satellite imagery archive of Landsat 5, 7 and 8.</p>
