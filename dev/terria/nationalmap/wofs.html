<p><a href='http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/flood/wofs'>Water Observations from Space (WOfS)</a> is a
    web service displaying historical surface water observations derived from satellite imagery for all of Australia
    from 1987 to present day. WOfS aims is to allow better understanding of where water is usually present; where it is
    seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been occasionally observed by satellite. WOfS displays the
    detected surface water from the Australia-wide satellite imagery archive of Landsat 5, 7 and 8.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Clear Count: </strong> the number of clear satellite observations for the period</li>
    <li><strong>Wet Count: </strong>the number of clear satellite observations in which water was detected</li>
    <li><strong>Summary: </strong>the percentage of clear observations in which water was detected</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence: </strong>the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national
        datasets <em>(Full Summary only)</em></li>
    <li><strong>Filtered Summary: </strong>A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water
        observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level <em>(Full Summary only)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The available time periods are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Full Summaries</strong> (1986 to present)</li>
    <li><strong>Annual Summaries</strong> (each year from 1986 to latest available full year)</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal Summaries</strong><ul>
        <li><strong>November to March</strong> (yearly from 1986 to latest available period)</li>
        <li><strong>April to October</strong> (yearly from 1986 to latest available period)</li>
    </ul></li>

    satellite data, <a href='http://www.ga.gov.au/dea'>Digital Earth Australia</a> (DEA).</p>
<p>DEA is a platform that uses spatial data and images recorded by satellites orbiting our planet to detect physical
    changes across Australia in unprecedented detail. DEA prepares these vast volumes of Earth observation data and
    makes it available to governments and industry for easy use.
